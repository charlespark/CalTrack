create a base class 'food'
bread, sandwich, etc. 'inherits from 'food''
class beverage < food
^^^^^DONE^^^^^


Grab all the checked items
Put all the ids in one array

Make one array of ALL the selected object IDs
Then, loop through each ID (treating each as a food) and then sum through all the IDs.


Make a LARGE ARRAY that has all the objects (and not the object_ids)

.find using 

Calculate
1. Grab all the ids
1.5 Find them in the database
2. Once they are all in one array, these can be summed up.

Food.find instead of Bread.find

And them sum it all up.

When doing the find to populate the array with selected items, find the objects and push the found objects into the array.
Dan says this will be a list of objects


Where is the empty ID entry coming from in check-box categories? 
>>> Not an issue, at least for the moment

Look for :include_hidden false to the checkbox area
