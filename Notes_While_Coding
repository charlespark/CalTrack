for bread, have an option or drop-down

Convert all categories to follow bread template.

- Do a 'find' on (i.e. bread.find) in order to communicate all fields for each selected item, in order to calculate.


- 
Could be simplified if instead of a class for each category, there was one category and they are all listed within.


Create a new class Food that has all the categories within (bread, sandwiches
Food.all.'sort' sort is not the actual term.

Can be displayed by category.


food.find
when collecting IDs

food.find_by, category bread
do this for each group, and render it differently in the HTML.
